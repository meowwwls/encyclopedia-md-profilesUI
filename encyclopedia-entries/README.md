## Interactive Project Descriptions/Demos/Previews

### Azureowl
#### &lt;del>  
Work in progress menu that lets users apply the &lt;del> tag on items by clicking on their respective buttons.    

* [index](../encyclopedia-entries-interactive/del-index.html)  (in progress)

#### background-attachment  
There will be three containers, each with applied background-attachment values of inherit, fixed, and local. Scroll will be the initial default of the body at the start of the interactive project; one container will inherit from body. Users will be able to apply property values to each container and the body.  

#### Math.PI  
There will be either a draggable circle or keyboard input fields to make changes to the diameter or radius. The circumference of the circle will change dynamically by the user inputs. The goal of this project is to interact with the diameter-circumference relationship and how Math.PI is useful for this.

### Meowwwls

#### &lt;frameset>

There will be 5 pre-made HTML files that can be used as content for frames within a frameset. The user will decide how many frames (up to 5) will be displayed in a frameset, as well as if they will be laid out as rows or columns. The user will also be able to specify how much space each frame should take up within the frameset. Each pre-made HTML file will be the source of its respective frame. (For example, file1.html will be the `src` of the first frame, file2.html will be tbe `src` of the second frame, and so on until the limit of 5 has been met.) 

#### :nth-last-child()

This will be a demonstration featuring several elements in one container. Each element will be a square of the same size, starting with the same background color. There will be inputs for the user to apply various styles to elements within the container that match a user-specified `:nth-last-child` selector. There will be options to change the border-radius, background-color, border, and height/width of the elements matching the selector. 

#### Array.prototype.unshift()

I have created a page for a fictional animal shelter requesting volunteers. Users can add their name to a list of volunteers. The list appears on the page and as each name is added, the last name to be added appears at the top of the list. Multiple names can be added at once as long as they are separated by a comma (<kbd>,</kbd>). The users can see in real-time that no matter how many names are added, the newest names are always at the top / front of the list. There is also a button to reset the list to the initial value, which is empty.
